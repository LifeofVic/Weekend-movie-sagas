# Movie Listings

## Description

Duration: 12 hours.

This project is a Movie Listing that will show the poster and title of the
movie. When an user clicks on the image of the movie the user will be redirected
to the details page. The details page will contain the movie's genre associated
to it and the description of the movie. The user will also have a back button
that will redirect the user to the homepage and select a new movie.
